# C# Math Ceiling Details - 2026-02-02

## Task Name
C# Math Ceiling for Floating Point

## Implementation Plan
1. Detail the `Math.Ceiling` method and its overloads for `double` and `decimal`.
2. Explain how `float` values are handled (implicit conversion to `double`).
3. Provide examples for positive numbers, negative numbers, and the "2 decimal place" logic again for completeness.

## Change Log
- Explained the behavior of `Math.Ceiling` with binary floating-point types.
- Clarified the lack of a native `float` overload.
- Documented negative number behavior (rounding towards zero).
